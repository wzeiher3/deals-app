            <p>This application allows users 
                to save and track deals that they find at various 
                restaurants. For example, if your favorite wings 
                place has a great deal on Wednesdays, you can make 
                a new deal by selecting the "Add Deal" tab and 
                inputing the price of the deal, name of the dish, 
                distance of the restaurant from your home, and the 
                day of the week. On the home page of the 
                application, it will display all of the deals you 
                have for the current day ordered by distance or 
                price. You can select the "My Week" tab in the nav 
                and see which deals are on which days of the week. 
                You can also select the "All Deals" tab to see a 
                list of all your deals. For a demo account, use these 
                credentials:
