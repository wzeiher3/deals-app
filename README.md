## About Deals Tracker

My project is an application that will allow users to save and track deals that they find at various restaurants. For example, if your favorite wings place has a great deal on Wednesdays, you can make a new deal by selecting the "Add Deal" tab and inputing the price of the deal, name of the dish, distance of the restaurant from your home, and the day of the week. On the home page of the application, it will display all of the deals you have for the current day ordered by distance or price. You can select the "My Week" tab in the nav and see which deals are on which days of the week. You can also select the "All Deals" tab to see a list of all your deals.
